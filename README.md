# Neural Network Package
## Python Machine learning Framework
A Machine Learning Framework for mutliclass classifictaion problems built 100% in Python using NumPy.


## Features
- Support for binary and multiclass classification problems
- 3 Different Activation Functions (Sigmoid, tanh, ReLU)
- Prediction Accuracy and F1 Score as evaluation Parameters
- Working Example of the package using the [MNIST database of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

## Installation Guide
1. Clone this Repository
2. Use pip to install the package
3. Test the installation anywhere on your machine by running

   ` import neural_network_package as nnp`

   ` nnp.test()`

4. Run the MNIST Example and experiment with the different training parameters.
